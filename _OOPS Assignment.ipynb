    "Q1) Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",

    "    of the objects that will be created from the class.\n",
    "    An object is an instance of a class, created at runtime. Objects are variables of the class type and contain the actual data. Objects can access the properties\n",
    "    and behaviors defined in their class.\n",
    "    Example: Consider a class called \"Car\" which has properties such as make, model, and year, and behaviors such as start, stop, and accelerate. Each car object\n",
    "    created from the Car class would have its own unique make, model, and year, but would share the same behaviors defined in the Car class."
